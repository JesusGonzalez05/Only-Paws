# Project 3: OnlyPaws by overREACTors

## Description
Welcome to OnlyPaws! OnlyPaws is a full-stack web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js) and following the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern. It is a social media platform for your furry friends (only)! 

With OnlyPaws, users can create a profile of their pets, connect with other pets and form communities, find and share resources such as local veterinarians, pet stores, and dog parks, and participate in discussions related to pets

We hope you enjoy using OnlyPaws and that it helps you connect with other pet lovers and find the resources you need for your pets.
